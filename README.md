Click on build_visual_studio_vr_pybullet_double.bat and open build3/vs2010/0_Bullet3Solution.sln When asked,
convert the projects to a newer version of Visual Studio. If you installed Python in the C:\ root directory,
the batch file should find it automatically. Otherwise, edit this batch file to choose where Python include/lib
directories are located.
